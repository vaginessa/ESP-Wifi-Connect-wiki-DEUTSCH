There are three ways to communicate with the remote device through the internet.

1. Communicating using computer's internet connection and USB.
2. Communicating using Ethernet Shield.
3. Communicating using WiFi module.

For now only fist case is available.

## TOKEN

TOKEN is a string like "_16CA361E-1212-48BB-8C2C-9E59013F6113_", generated by the app during project creation.. TOKEN needs for identifying clients on server.

## Communicating using computer's internet connection and USB

For using computer's internet connection we should:

* Add the project token to sketch and send it via serial connection as an response for "get_token" command request:
```c++ 

String token = "project_token";

...

void parseCommand() {
  StaticJsonBuffer<100> commandBuffer;
  JsonObject& root = commandBuffer.parseObject(inputString);
  
  String cmd = root["cmd"];

  if (cmd == "get_token") {
    sendToken();
  }
}

void sendToken() {
  Serial.print ("{\"token\":\""+token+"\"}\n");
}

...
```
* [Download](http://dkgadget.net/dkgadgetconnector/DK_Gadget_Connector_0.9.1.zip) and run DK Gadget Connector
(needs Java JRE);
* Connect the device to computer by USB;
* Click "Connect" button in Gadget Connector Application;
* In the mobile app select Internet in a connection type dialog.
